# Custom Error Pages

- To have custom error pages we need to have our custom pages first. Let us create a custom error page.
- Go to your domain directory under ***/var/www/html***

```
# cd /var/www/html/lltest1/
# echo "###  404 - Page doesn't exist  ###" > 404.html
```

- Now we need to config this in our config file of this domain

```
